# AI for Frailty Detection  

This project utilizes AI to analyze and interpret complex data in order to pinpoint essential physiological and behavioral traits that could act as biomarkers for frailty. These identified biomarkers have the potential to play a crucial role in predicting and addressing frailty in individuals. By harnessing the power of AI, this research aims to enhance healthcare and enhance the quality of life for the elderly.
The project description can be found in 'FrailtyDetectionWithAI.pdf', while the solution is in 'ASolutionForFrailtyDetectionWithAI.pdf'. Please refer to these documents for more information.
